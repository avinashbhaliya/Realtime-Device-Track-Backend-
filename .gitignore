Here are the steps outlined in the image, broken down point by point:

**1. Check Browser Geolocation Support:**
   - Verify if the user's browser supports the geolocation feature.

**2. Set Geolocation Options:**
   - Configure geolocation settings for high accuracy, a 5-second timeout, and no caching.

**3. Continuous Location Tracking:**
   - Employ the `watchPosition` function to monitor the user's location in real-time.

**4. Location Data Transmission:**
   - Transmit latitude and longitude data using a socket with the event name "send-location."
   - Log any errors encountered during transmission to the console.

**5. Map Initialization:**
   - Create a map centered at coordinates (0, 0) with a zoom level of 15 using the Leaflet library.
   - Incorporate OpenStreetMap tiles into the map for display.

**6. Marker Object Creation:**
   - Establish an empty object named `markers` to store marker information.

**7. Location Data Handling:**
   - Upon receiving location data via the socket:
     - Extract the user ID, latitude, and longitude from the data.
     - Center the map on the newly received coordinates.
     - If a marker already exists for the user ID:
       - Update the marker's position to reflect the new coordinates.
     - Otherwise, create a new marker at the specified coordinates and add it to the map.

**8. User Disconnection Handling:**
   - When a user disconnects:
     - Remove their marker from the map.
     - Delete their marker information from the `markers` object.
